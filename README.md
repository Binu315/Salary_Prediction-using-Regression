# Salary Prediction Using Regression Models

## Project Overview
This project predicts employee salaries using various regression techniques. The dataset was collected from Kaggle and contains features such as Age, Gender, degree, experience and job role. Multiple regression models were applied to predict salaries accurately.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing and Missing Value Handling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
- Label Encoding for Categorical Features
- Regression Models Implemented:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Model Evaluation Metrics:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Visualization of Actual vs Predicted values
- Comparison of model performance
- Customizable salary predictions for new inputs

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Usage
1. Load the dataset `Salary_Data.csv`.
2. Run the Colab Notebook `salary_prediction_reg.ipynb` to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and make predictions.
3. Visualize results with actual vs predicted salary plots.

## Project Outcome
- Implemented multiple regression models to predict salaries.
- Evaluated model performance using multiple metrics.
- Generated a comparison of model predictions versus actual salaries.
- Enabled customized predictions for new employee data.
